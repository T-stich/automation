# automation
Ready-made devices for automation are very expensive and cost several hundred to thousand euros. That's why we build it. I include here a collection of my Python scripts. Which are used for automating Tasks. Mostly outdoors on the Garden. Eg. Watering, but also manipulation of several values on my hydroponic system.


Currently i am on the BUILDING PHASE. I am currently wiring all parts together and also try not to kill myself with 230V.

...coming soon
